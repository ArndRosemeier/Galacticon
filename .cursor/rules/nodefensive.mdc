Do not use defensive programming of any kind. No silent errors and avoid all purpose variable types. Programm for easy debuggability, errors need to be visible and loud.
Also when using functions in a class, just use them without a fallback in case the function does not exist. Those fallbacks just lead to hard to debug code.
Always use strong typing, avoid constructs like any,
